/// Represents different types of events that can trigger database changes:
/// - [ReducerEvent]: A reducer call caused the transaction
/// - [SubscribeAppliedEvent]: Initial subscription data being applied
/// - [UnknownTransactionEvent]: Transaction source is unknown
///
/// The sealed class pattern enables exhaustive pattern matching:
/// ```dart
/// void handleEvent(Event event) {
///   switch (event) {
///     case ReducerEvent(:final reducerName):
///       print('Reducer: $reducerName');
///     case SubscribeAppliedEvent():

///     case UnknownTransactionEvent():
///       print('Unknown transaction');

  /// ```dart
  /// if (event.reducerName == 'create_note') {
  ///   final args = event.reducerArgs as CreateNoteArgs;
  ///   print('Title: ${args.title}');
